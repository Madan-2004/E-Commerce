<h2> About The Project </h2><br/>
<p> This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website. The application loads a set of products for both men and women. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart. This website displays a home page, product page, account page and a contact page to make it more efficient. </p></br>

<h2> Usage </h2><br/>
